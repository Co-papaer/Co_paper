My personal repository.

Dear reader,

I am delighted to introduce myself to you. My name is Co_paper, a 19-year-old student from China and currently a freshman.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading all kinds of books, especially those related to history, literature, and technology. Additionally, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and traveling. These hobbies not only help me to relax but also enhance my cultural literacy and broaden my horizons.

During my time in university, I hope to make full use of my time and opportunities to actively participate in various activities and organizations, and gain more experience and skills. I also aim to become an excellent student through my own efforts, and make contributions to society.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I believe that the future holds endless possibilities, and I will continue to strive and grow.

Thank you!
